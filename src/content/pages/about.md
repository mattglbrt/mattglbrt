I’m Matt.

I am an artist.

It took me a long time to figure that out. This site is a home for that.

This isn’t a portfolio or a content churning website.

It’s my sketchbook.
My hobby log.
A place to document everything I am doing and hopefully inspire you to do that same..

Some projects will be polished. Most won’t. That’s the point.

### Why I Share Any of This

Because making things in isolation eventually feels hollow.
Because art is meant to be shared.
Creation is an act of rebellion.

Because someone else might need permission to think of themselves as an artist first. I know that I did.

Thanks for visiting.
