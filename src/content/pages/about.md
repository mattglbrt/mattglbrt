I’m Matt.

I am an artist.

It took me a long time to figure that out.

This is my sketchbook.
My project log.
A place to document everything I am doing and hopefully inspire you.

I focus on miniature painting, scale modeling, sculpting, dioramas, and 3D printing.

### Why I Share Any of This

Every act of creation is an act of rebellion.

Someone else might need permission to think of themselves as an artist first.

I know that I did.
