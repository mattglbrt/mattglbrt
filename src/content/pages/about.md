I’m Matt.

I am an artist.

It took me a long time to figure that out. I paint miniatures, build worlds, design games, bind books, sketch ideas, and spend an unreasonable amount of time thinking about imaginary places. This site is a home for that.

This isn’t a portfolio or a content churning website.

It’s my sketchbook.
My hobby log.
A place to document projects.

You’ll find:

* Miniature painting and terrain builds

* Tabletop and role-playing game design

* Handmade objects and small creative experiments

* Notes on process, tools, and inspiration

Some projects will be polished. Most won’t. That’s the point.

### Why I Share Any of This

Because making things in isolation eventually feels hollow.
Because art is better when it is shared.
Because someone else might need permission to think of themselves as an artist first. I know that I did.

Thanks for visiting.
